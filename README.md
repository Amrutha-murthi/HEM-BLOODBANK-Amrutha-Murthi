# MERN Blood Bank Management System

## Overview

The MERN Blood Bank Management System is a full-stack web application designed to manage blood bank-related information. The project utilizes the MERN stack, incorporating MongoDB as the database, Express.js and Node.js for the server-side, and React.js for the client-side.

Key features of the project include JWT-based user authentication, real-time data updates, and interactive user interfaces. The system is built with scalability and optimal performance in mind, implementing best practices for data management.

## Model Used

The project uses MongoDB as the database to store and manage blood bank-related data. MongoDB's NoSQL nature provides flexibility in handling diverse types of data, making it suitable for the dynamic requirements of a blood bank management system.
